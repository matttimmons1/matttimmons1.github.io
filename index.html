        <h2>What is CSGO?</h2>
        <p>&#9;CS:GO (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive) is a first-person shooter video game that was developed by Valve Corporation and Hidden Path Entertainment. It is the fourth installment in the Counter-Strike series and was released in August 2012.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the game, players are divided into two teams, terrorists and counter-terrorists, and compete against each other in various game modes. The objective of each game mode varies, but typically involves either planting or defusing a bomb, rescuing or guarding hostages, or eliminating the opposing team.
        <br>
        <br>
        Players earn money by performing well in each round, which can be used to buy better weapons, gear, and equipment. CS:GO is widely considered one of the most popular esports games, with professional teams and tournaments held around the world.
